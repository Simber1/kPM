# Promod - The competetive BF3 experience

This mod is heavily based on the Call of Duty 4 Promod, and kinda works like CS:GO's defusal gametype. Attackers need to kill all enemies or plant the bomb before the timer runs out. Defenders need to defend both bombsites or wait for the timer to run down.
